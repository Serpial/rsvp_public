# RSVP Web App  

## Project Summary  
This web app allowed guests at my wedding to confirm their attendance and select their meal choices.  

## Purpose  
I built this project as a learning opportunity.  

After visiting the index page, which provides general information, users are directed to the RSVP form, where they enter **three six-letter words** from their invitation.  

The app consists of:  
- A **React.js** front end  
- A **Java Spring** API  
- A **MongoDB Atlas** database  

The key skills I aimed to learn during this project:  
- Docker  
- Spring Security  
- Authentication and identity management in React  

## Exploring the Test/Staging Deployment  
The app is deployed via Docker on [Render.com](http://render.com), which offers a reliable free tier and convenient deployment features.  

ðŸš€ **Note:** On the free tier, services experience a spin-up delay, including both the UI and backend. Additionally, MongoDB may take time to initialize.  

### Sample Users  
Use any of these word sets to test the RSVP form:  

| Word Set              |  
|----------------------|  
| theory-county-cookie |  
| driver-series-client |  
| breath-police-sister |  
| effort-policy-editor |  
| sector-insect-device |
